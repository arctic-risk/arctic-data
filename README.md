Author: Klaus G. Paul

Repository to capture data, information, and insights from data related to climate change in the arctic.

# Mini Apps

Notebooks and streamlit apps that visualise some meaningful aspects of what is happening in the Arctic, and also how to get
hold of the data sources yourself.

how much of the soil is thawing across the season (also called the "active layer thickness").
