# Mini Apps

This section contains a series of [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) apps and jupyter notebooks that facilitate using existing data
from the arctic. Have a look, change the code, read up on the background.

## Create Animated Arctic Sea Ice gif

Use this app to create an animation of arcitc sea ice cover since 1978/1979. Check how much the ice covered area has changed over
time, by looking at annual comparisons of the same months across multiple years.


This app uses [NSIDC Sea Ice Index G02135](https://nsidc.org/data/g02135) data.

## Compare Sea Ice with a land mass that matters to you

This app allows you to compare various sea ice extents with a (sub) continental landmass. Want to find out the area
of summer sea ice lost and compare it to SE Asia, or W Europe? Then this app is for you.
